# **THE BEST WORDPRESS POPUP AND CONVERSION MARKETING PLUGIN**
If you are looking to increase your sales, your email subscribers, and grow your business, Personizely is the conversion marketing toolkit you are looking for. With this conversion toolkit, you will be able to turn those website visitors ready to leave your site into subscribers and even prospective customers. Personizely will let you create personalized email subscription prompts, popup forms, sticky announcement bars, and even an opt-in form, as well as many other interactive popups. The best part is that it won't take you hours to set it up either, just minutes!

Unlike typical WordPress plugins, Personizely prioritizes user experience above everything else. Our goal is to make things work exactly the way you need them to for your particular situation, so Personizely features a slew of personalization features and smart targeting. This will allow you to show the right user the right popup at the right time.

Personizely's popups and opt-in forms for newsletters are fully compatible with mobile formats and are fully responsive. This way your marketing messages are available clearly and formatted ideally for whatever device (laptop, desktop, mobile phone, or tablet) that a visitor might be utilizing. We have optimized Personizely for both server and web performance because we understand the importance of conversion optimization, SEO, and marketing.

Our goal has been to eliminate the pain points from the generation of personalized popup forms. We know you want this process to be simple. Now, smart business owners, developers, and designers love using the Personizely conversion marketing toolkit. Here are just a few reasons why:


# **Drag & Drop Popup Builder**
We are over the slow and bloated popup maker plugins, and we know you are too. We built Personizely to be adaptable to let you create custom popups, newsletter opt-ins, announcement bars, and slide-in popups, as well as high-conversion lead generating forms quickly. This will be an essential tool for enhancing your marketing workflow.
With your drag & drop popup builder, you can control and customize easily the expression and feel of your opt-in popups. You can even add spin the wheel games, countdowns, and other dynamic popups that are suited to the behavior of the user.


# **Pre-Built Popup Templates For Conversion Increase**
So why is it that building marketing popups that generate high conversions takes so much time? Mostly it's because other plugins require you to build the popup from scratch, something that, unless you really want to, you do not actually need to do.
If you are looking to create a free shipping bar, newsletter popup, announcement bar with (or without) a countdown, a slide-in popup, coupon popup, newsletter popup, or any other advanced popup model, Personizely has a template in place to help you start beyond the proverbial 'start line' inside the easy popup builder.
Personizely is stocked with dozens of templates to help you create popups faster. Check out our gallery for all the options you have.


# **Onsite Retargeting And Popups For New Visitors**
The number of visitors who leave your site never to return is at a staggering 70%. Personizely can help you prevent them all from being 'lost' by leveraging the strategy of employing exit-intent popups. Instead, it can convert a lot of them into subscribers, and potentially, paying customers.
At the moment if a user is intending to leave your site, they can be presented with exit-intent popups, a strategy that helps convert an additional 4% - 6% of your site's visitors. On top of that, exit-intent popups can be utilized to show different popup messages to visitors who have returned to your site vs those who are new.
These go a long way in reducing cart abandonment, saving you money on retargeting ads and pay-per-click advertisements.


# **Behavior-Based Personalization And Advanced Targeting**
Personizely allows you to highly customize your popups for users based on an advanced range of factors including (but not limited to) the visitor's geographic location, when they click on a specific link or based on a historical analysis of their past popup clicking behaviors.
Whether a user had seen another popup in a different marketing campaign, previously clicked on a marketing popup, viewed a particular number of pages, or closed a particular marketing popup in the past - can help drill down to the type of popup that is most effective for converting this particular visitor into a subscriber or a customer, helping you improve your lead generation efforts and grow your sales.


# **Email Marketing Integration, Popup A/B Testing, And Popup Analytics**
Personizely does not slow down your site as it employs its advanced popup algorithms to help you grow your site and business as many other popup tools tend to do. That is because unlike other plugins, Personizely does not employ wp-ajax for popup analytics setup and slow down your site due to the cache settings. On top of that, caching plugins are inherently skewing the data in typical popup plugins.
Personizely addressed both of those concerns with a superior popup generation infrastructure, allowing you to employ A/B popup testing that is reliable. This also allows for accurate data returned during conversion analytics and email marketing and CRM integrations are made seamless.
